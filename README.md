<h1>Welcome. </h1>
<h2> <strong>My name is Kalisha Allen.</strong></h2>

<p> My website is a personal website, I built during my Code Louisville course, but I will be using it for my actually website. My goal for this website is to showcase a digital portfolio of my experience, skills, and capabilites as a web developer.

<p>After going back and forth between frameworks and CSS/ JS. I decided to go with Bootstrap, because of the responsive capabilites. </p>
<p> For the purpose of this project, my site currently consist of three page, which are home, about and contact page. There is also a resume page that I am still working. I plan to take this site online, however the resume page should not be considered for grading purposes. </p>

<p>In term of custom css, I choose to build my contact form,carousel, sticky foote, which you will find in the main.css file.</p> 

<p>I used Jquery to create an light box on my about.hmtl page for my photo gallery.</p>
