<h1>Welcome. </h1>
<h2> <strong>My name is Kalisha Allen.</strong></h2>

<p> My website is a personal website, I built during my Code Louisville course, but I will be using it for my actually website. My goal for this website is to showcase a digital portfolio of my experience, skills, and capabilites as a web developer.

<p>After going back and forth between frameworks and CSS/ JS. I decided to go with Bootstrap, because of its responsive capabilites and ease navagation with responsiveness. </p>
<p> My site currently consist of three page, which are home, about and contact page.</p>

<p>In term of custom css, I choose to build my contact form,carousel, sticky foote, which you will find in the main.css file.</p> 

<p>In terms of JS and responsiveness, I created an alert the say's "Valar Mohugulia" and included a headline that appear will after you click the alert box. The headline stays below my nav bar, because I included it in my html body.</p>
