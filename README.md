<p> Hi, my name is Kalisha Allen. Welcome to my website that I created in CodeLouisville. The purpose for my website is to showcase a digital portfolio of my professional experience and skills. 

I started from scratch utilizing bootstrap for responsive design, custom css, and AJAX. 

I created a homepage, about page, career page, and contact page. </p>
