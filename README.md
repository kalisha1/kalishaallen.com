<h1>Welcome to my site </h1>
<h2> <strong>My name is Kalisha Allen</strong></h2>

<p> I choose to build website as a digital portfolio. It built during my Code Louisville course, but I will be using it for my actually website. My goal for this website is to showcase a digital portfolio of my experience, skills, and capabilites as a web developer.

<p>After going back and forth between frameworks and CSS/ JS. I decided to go with Bootstrap, because of the responsive capabilites. </p>
<p> For the purpose of this project, my sites currently consist of an index.html, contact1.html. 
<p>I also have custom coding in  scripts.js, apps.js, and main.css </p>
<p><strong>There is also a resume page that I am still working with and should not be considered for this project.</strong> </p>

<p>In term of custom css, I choose to build my contact form,lightbox, sticky footer, which you will find in the main.css file.</p> 

<p>I used Jquery to create an light box on my index.hmtl page for my photo gallery.</p>
<p>I used css to create contact form on my contact1.html page.</p>
